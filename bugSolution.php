The solution is to always use strict comparison (`===`) when comparing variables to avoid unexpected behavior due to PHP's type juggling.

```php
<?php
$str = '0';
$bool = false;

if ($str === $bool) {
    echo "They are equal (strict comparison)\n";
} else {
    echo "They are not equal (strict comparison)\n";
}
?>
```
This will correctly identify that '0' and false are not equal because they are of different types.
